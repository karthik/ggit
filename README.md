# Git Graphics

This package is a helper package to the R implementation of Git, `git2r`. It provides routines to visualize activity in git repositories, such as commit frequency, author contributions and also (eventually) allow you to generate a full contribution graph (like you see on a GitHub profile) for one or more repositories.

The package is in early development but should be complete soon. 

__Installation__

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ropensci/ggit")
```
